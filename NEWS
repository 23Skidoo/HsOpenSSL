Changes from 0.2 to [the next release]
--------------------------------------
* Applied a patch by Adam Langley:
  - tests/DSA.hs: Add a DSA test: this just adds a binary which tests
    a few simple DSA cases (and runs a timing test) and prints "PASS"
    as the last line of stdout in the case that everything looks good.
    It doesn't include any hooks nor framework for running these.


Changes from 0.1.1. to 0.2
--------------------------
* Applied patches by Adam Langley:
  - OpenSSL.DSA: Add DSA support
  - OpenSSL.BN: Add support for fast Integer<->BN conversions
  - OpenSSL.BN: New BN utility function, newBN
  - OpenSSL.BN: FIX: set the BN ptr to NULL before calling BN_dec2bn,
    otherwise that function thinks that there's a valid BN there
  - OpenSSL.Utils: Add utility functions to print and read hex numbers


Changes from 0.1 to 0.1.1
-------------------------
* Moved hidden modules from Exposed-Modules to Other-Modules.
