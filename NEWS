Changes from 0.4 to ???
-----------------------
* Applied patches by Adam Langley:
  - Fix BN<->Integer conversions on 64-bit systems
  - Another 64-bit fix (OpenSSL.ASN1.peekASN1String)


Changes from 0.3.1 to 0.4
-------------------------
* Applied patches by Adam Langley:
  - Add the beginnings of session support
  - Add an example SSL server


Changes from 0.3 to 0.3.1
-------------------------
* OpenSSL.EVP.Base64: Fix a bug in an internal function `decodeBlock':
  decodeBase64* didn't drop the padding NUL.
* Applied patches by Adam Langley:
  - Updates for 6.8.1 (also *requires* 6.8.1 now)
  - tests/Base64.hs: Test for Base64


Changes from 0.2 to 0.3
-----------------------
* Applied patches by Adam Langley:
  - tests/DSA.hs: Add a DSA test: this just adds a binary which tests
    a few simple DSA cases (and runs a timing test) and prints "PASS"
    as the last line of stdout in the case that everything looks good.
    It doesn't include any hooks nor framework for running these.
  - Bug fix for fast Integer<->BN functions
  - OpenSSL.Cipher: Add non-EVP cipher support
  - OpenSSL.EVP.Digest: Add HMAC support in EVP
  - OpenSSL.Random: Add OpenSSL.Random
  - OpenSSL.BN: Additional utility functions in BN and exposing BN


Changes from 0.1.1. to 0.2
--------------------------
* Applied patches by Adam Langley:
  - OpenSSL.DSA: Add DSA support
  - OpenSSL.BN: Add support for fast Integer<->BN conversions
  - OpenSSL.BN: New BN utility function, newBN
  - OpenSSL.BN: FIX: set the BN ptr to NULL before calling BN_dec2bn,
    otherwise that function thinks that there's a valid BN there
  - OpenSSL.Utils: Add utility functions to print and read hex numbers


Changes from 0.1 to 0.1.1
-------------------------
* Moved hidden modules from Exposed-Modules to Other-Modules.
* Added "time >= 1.1.1" to the Build-Depends.
