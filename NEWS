Changes from 0.5.1 to 0.5.2
---------------------------
* Fixed incorrect dependency declaration in HsOpenSSL.cabal. No
  semantical changes to the code.

Changes from 0.5 to 0.5.1
-------------------------
* Fixed breakage on 64-bit architectures.
  Reported by: Neumark PÃ©ter

Changes from 0.4.2 to 0.5
-------------------------
* Fixed breakage on GHC 6.10.1. And now requires 6.10.1...
* Applied a patch by Taru Karttunen:
  -  Add pkcs5_pbkdf2_hmac_sha1 to OpenSSL.EVP.Digest


Changes from 0.4.1 to 0.4.2
---------------------------
* No .hs files which are generated from .hsc files should be in the
  tarball. If any .hs files are outdated, Cabal seems to compile the
  outdated files instead of newer .hsc files.


Changes from 0.4 to 0.4.1
-------------------------
* Applied patches by Adam Langley:
  - Fix BN<->Integer conversions on 64-bit systems
  - Another 64-bit fix (OpenSSL.ASN1.peekASN1String)
  - Add ByteString version of digestBS
  - Fix the foreign types of the cipher functions to use CInt, not Int
  - 64-bit fix for HMAC
  - Turn the Session IO inside out
  - Silly cosmetic change


Changes from 0.3.1 to 0.4
-------------------------
* Applied patches by Adam Langley:
  - Add the beginnings of session support
  - Add an example SSL server


Changes from 0.3 to 0.3.1
-------------------------
* OpenSSL.EVP.Base64: Fix a bug in an internal function `decodeBlock':
  decodeBase64* didn't drop the padding NUL.
* Applied patches by Adam Langley:
  - Updates for 6.8.1 (also *requires* 6.8.1 now)
  - tests/Base64.hs: Test for Base64


Changes from 0.2 to 0.3
-----------------------
* Applied patches by Adam Langley:
  - tests/DSA.hs: Add a DSA test: this just adds a binary which tests
    a few simple DSA cases (and runs a timing test) and prints "PASS"
    as the last line of stdout in the case that everything looks good.
    It doesn't include any hooks nor framework for running these.
  - Bug fix for fast Integer<->BN functions
  - OpenSSL.Cipher: Add non-EVP cipher support
  - OpenSSL.EVP.Digest: Add HMAC support in EVP
  - OpenSSL.Random: Add OpenSSL.Random
  - OpenSSL.BN: Additional utility functions in BN and exposing BN


Changes from 0.1.1. to 0.2
--------------------------
* Applied patches by Adam Langley:
  - OpenSSL.DSA: Add DSA support
  - OpenSSL.BN: Add support for fast Integer<->BN conversions
  - OpenSSL.BN: New BN utility function, newBN
  - OpenSSL.BN: FIX: set the BN ptr to NULL before calling BN_dec2bn,
    otherwise that function thinks that there's a valid BN there
  - OpenSSL.Utils: Add utility functions to print and read hex numbers


Changes from 0.1 to 0.1.1
-------------------------
* Moved hidden modules from Exposed-Modules to Other-Modules.
* Added "time >= 1.1.1" to the Build-Depends.
